    DIRECTIONS: Please use the object below for practice problems 1-3.
    */

      name: "Julio Gonzales",
      age: "23",
      occupation: "Software Engineer"

    PROBLEM 1: Given the “fakeProfile” object above, write a function that uses a “for…in” loop and only prints the three properties of this object.  Don't forget to invoke this function!
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Given the "fakeProfile" object above, write a function that uses a "for..in" loop and prints the three properties and their values side-by-side.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Given the “fakeProfile” object above, write a function that uses a “for…in” loop and only prints the value of the name property in a sentence that reads: “Hello, my name is Julio Gonzales.”  Hint: you will need to include an if statement within the loop.
   */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable that holds an object with three properties: Red, Green, and Blue (or R,G,B).  Give each of these properties any number value from 0 to 255.  Write a function called getMyRGB() that loops through each property and prints the number values of each to the console.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): Given the same “fakeProfile” object we used in problems 1-3, the following loop prints “undefined” which is not what you were expecting.  Please fix the loop with the correct syntax to successfully print out “Julio Gonzales, 23, Software Engineer.
