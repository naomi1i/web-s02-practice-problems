    PROBLEM 3: Given the “fakeProfile” object above, write a function that uses a “for…in” loop and only prints the value of the name property in a sentence that reads: “Hello, my name is Julio Gonzales.”  Hint: you will need to include an if statement within the loop.

    PROBLEM 4: Declare a variable that holds an object with three properties: Red, Green, and Blue (or R,G,B).  Give each of these properties any number value from 0 to 255.  Write a function called getMyRGB() that loops through each property and prints the number values of each to the console.

    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): Given the same “fakeProfile” object we used in problems 1-3, the following loop prints “undefined” which is not what you were expecting.  Please fix the loop with the correct syntax to successfully print out “Julio Gonzales, 23, Software Engineer.
