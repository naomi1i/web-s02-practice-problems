    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Create an empty array named "empty" using array literals.
    */
    const empty = [];

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Create an array named "primitives" that contains one of each primitive type (ie. boolean, number, string, null and undefined) using an array literal.
    */
    const primitives = [true, 1, 'hey!', undefined, null];

    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Create an array named "matrix" of 3 arrays. The subarrays should contain 2 numbers each.
    */
    const matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Create an array named "falsy" and add 4 falsy values to it.
    */
    const falsy = ['', null, undefined, 3 === '3',];

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): Someone tried creating an array of students, but there's an error somewhere. Fix the issue(s) with the array "students".
    */
    const students = ["Alice", "Stacy", "Bob  Marley", "Charlie", "Puth"];
