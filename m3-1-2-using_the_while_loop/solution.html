    PROBLEM 1: Use a while loop to print numbers counting backwards from 5 to 0.
    */

    PROBLEM 2: Using a while loop, find and print the sum of all numbers from 1-10.
    */

      sum += j;

    PROBLEM 3: Use a while loop to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 10.
    */
    let num = 1;
    while (num < 10) {
      console.log(num);
      num += 2;

    PROBLEM 4: Use a while loop to print all the books titles in the array "books" up until you find the first book that begins with "The".
    */
    const books = ["To kill a Mockingbird", "Harry Potter", "Things fall apart", "The old man and the sea", "Macbeth"];
    let i = 0;

    while (i < books.length && !books[i].startsWith("The")) {
      console.log(books[i])
      i++;
    }

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): Fix the issue(s) with the code block below so it prints out the string "hello world" 5 times
    */

    let count = 5;
    while (count) {
      console.log("hello world");
