    /*
   PROBLEM 1: Create an array from the string's characters below and console.log the resulting array to the console.
   */
    const name = 'Bernadette';

    console.log(name.split(''));

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Create an array from the string's characters below and console.log the resulting array to the console.
    */
    const hawaiianFish = 'humuhumunukunukuāpuaʻa';

    console.log(hawaiianFish.split(''));

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Create an array from the string's words below and console.log the resulting array to the console.
   */
    const motivation = 'Today is your opportunity to build the tomorrow you want';

    console.log(motivation.split(' '));

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Create an array from the string's words below and console.log the resulting array to the console.
    */
    const proverb = 'The bamboo that bends is stronger that the oak that resists';

    console.log(proverb.split(' '));

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The expected output of the code below is to split the myString string into an array using the , character as a separator, and then print out the resulting array to the console. However, when you run this code, you notice that myArray is an empty array.

    Here is more information about the split method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split

    const myString = "apple,banana,orange,pear";
    const myArray = myString.split();

    console.log(myArray);
    */
    const myString = "apple,banana,orange,pear";
    const myArray = myString.split(','); //putting a comma in the string will separate the string into elements every time there is a comma in the string
    console.log(myArray);
